      <p class="symptoms">
        - Molly fish prefer to live in shallow surface waters.</p>
            <p class="treatments">- In the wild, they are usually found in loosely vegetated coastal
              streams.</p>
            <p class="treatments">- However, these fish are known to do well in lakes, estuaries, deltas, swamps, ponds, marshes and even in
              ephemeral places like roadside ditches.</p>
            <p class="treatments">- They prefer to stay under floating vegetation or near structures to stay out
              of view of predators.</p>
            <p class="treatments">- Ideally, they like water with a pH range of between 7.5 and 8.5 and a temperature of between
              64 and 82 Â°F.</p>
